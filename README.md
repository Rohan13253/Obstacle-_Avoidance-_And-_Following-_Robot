# Obstacle-_Avoidance-_And-_Following-_Robot
I created this project during my first year. The code provided here is for the robot used in the project. All the code is self-explanatory and can be easily understood with basic knowledge of C++.

Here are the components used:
1. Arduino UNO R3 board 
2. IC L293D
3. 2 gear motors
4. 9V battery (To power the Arduino board)
5. 4AAA battery (To power the gear motors)
6. Jumper cables
7. Breadboard
 

I hope this information is helpful. Let me know if you have any questions!
